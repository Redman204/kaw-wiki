## üß≠ Strategy Tips

- **"God Mode" Testing:**  
  After reducing Life to 3%, you may enter a phase where your actions have no effect, known as "God Mode." This lasts approximately 5 to 8 minutes and repeats every 5 to 8 minutes. During this time, refrain from using items unless instructed. To identify the optimal timing ("sweet spot") for your attacks:

  1. Use Angel of Light & Holy Wrath together 12 times and Locust Swarm 8 times. (When bar is full: AoL + HW 8 times, LS 5 times)
  2. Attempt to attack or assassinate Life.
  3. If unsuccessful, repeat step 1.
  4. Once successful, you have found the "sweet spot."
  5. Maintain this timing until the Epic Battle is complete.

  *Note:* If you overuse any item, you will need to wait for it to regenerate, which may reset the phase.
