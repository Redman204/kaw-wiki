# Welcome to the Silent Harmony KaW-Wiki

There are quite a few KaW-Wikis and -guides out there. Unfortunately none of them are well maintained and often lack many "modern" features and epic battles.
I set myself the goal to change that and will collect all the necessary information throughout all the guides, wikis and forums I can find.

Feel free to give my <a href="https://github.com/SHY-PeaceKeeper-SHY/kaw-wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github repo</a> a visit. You can also clone it to have all the guides available offline (written in Markdown) or edit them to your likings and needs. (Important: This wont effect the guides available on this wiki!)

If you have any questions, criticism or requests, feel free to let me know on Github (comments-feature in progress). 
You can also find me in KaW: SHY-PeaceKeeper-SHY
