# Quick Start Guide - get to Fatesands quickly

Hi there, this is a collection of information gathered from Kaw vets, aimed at giving you the best chance at growing fast. 
To grow quickly, you need to focus on unlocking Fatesands lands, that's when you actually start growth. This guide will focus on methods to growing and reaching Fatesands fast, as well as giving you the best build to use for initial growth that you can use for ANY future build style. 

To maximize your efforts getting there, there's a couple of things you need to do along the way. 

-There are main event legends which give every kind of plate. You should focus on achieving 37.5k or 60k event items depending on your size. These two event tiers will give you all the items you need to grow.
Then there is a side legend which unlocks after you collect 2000 main event items.
You'll get a choice between easy, medium, and hard.
In early game(pre Fatesands) you should choose the medium and easy difficulty. 
In late game(post Osmon Rai/Deepmine) you should choose the hard difficulty to build up fatesands plates.

-Complete daily PvP and PvE legends for 2 free chests which gives event items and trader tokens as well as silver bars 

-Throughout your game play, there are a variety of methods you can use to gather gold, such as ebs, vollies, SB, and even building flipping

Building flipping is a really easy way to get quick gold. The basic idea works off of dropping buildings for gold.
So, the goal is to save up enough plates to upgrade a building to a certain level so that when you destroy that building, you can immediately build and ug a building to the same level without losing any stats. 

Use these methods as extra boosts for buying lands and allies. Later on you'll learn to use them in more ways to continue your growth.


Here is a list of the best buildings to flip for gold:

-*New* HL buildings Lvl 1
2k HL plates req
~4T gold received

-DM buildings Lvl 4
100 DM plates req
~20T gold received

-FS building Lvl 8
199 FS plates req
~930T gold received

-Pal building Lvl 10
375 Pal plates req 
~10.9Q gold received


Now that you know how to grow and what methods to use, let's go over what you'll be using that gold on and *how* you'll be building. 

Your goal is to make as much gold as possible, so we should build the buildings that will make you the most gold to begin with. 

List of buildings that make the most plunder:
Spy atk>Atk def heavy>atk balanced>atk heavy atk>towers

With this logic, spy builds make the *most* plunder and offer pvp benefits
Atk build/tanks offer defense against spy builds and moderate to high plunder if built right, thus you should build a hybrid spy heavy build until you reach FS, at that stage you should choose to go either all spy atk buildings or all atk def heavy to solidify your build choice. This is the easiest stage to change up your build and go in a specific direction so don't worry about what you build now, it'll be easy to change later.

The reason you don't want to just build spy buildings is because that creates a weird mechanic that Pure Spy builds use, it's not great for early growth so I recommend the balanced hybrid build to give you an even income of gold. 

I do not however, recommend towers whatsoever, and if you are going to build towers for system wars, do not build them before FS and Pal, only place defense on FS and Pal to maximize your plunder and growth. That applies to all build types, including tanks. The game has evolved past the use of towers, for actual defense, focus on growing your bfa and charms. 

Here is my suggested build guide to max plunder, feel free to adapt it as you like to fit your build goals.  Don't worry about maxing out the lower lands, you should focus on unlocking FS as fast as possible. 

*As a reminder, only spend gold on lands and allies, and only use plates to build and ug buildings*

Build 10 forges and 14x SOS on LL
Build 5 lvl 3 Torture Garden and 10 lvl 3 Volary on HL(you will be swapping these out for the higher level buildings once you start collecting trader tokens more, save your HL tokens)
Build 9 lvl 10 Rime Fortress and 14 lvl 10 Unkari Ice Tree, and then one lvl 1 of each of those on hf
Build 10 Sea Nymph Temple and 15 Cult of the Abyssal Eye on abyss
Build 9 lvl 10 and one lvl 1 Zeruan Cielfortress and 15 lvl 10 Prizmai Ashtarak on OR
Build 10 lvl 4 Khruta-Kadh Forgefortress and 15 lvl 4 Gobblyn Ha' on DM

Once you unlock FS, you should start building one type of building depending on your build choice. 

Lvl 8 Mahal of the Sublime Ones -or- lvl 8 Oasis of the Green Dancers on FS
Lvl 10 Fortress of the Umbral Cascade -or- lvl 10 Penumbral Mirrorhive on Pal
Lvl 6 Gearspring Bastion -or- lvl 6 Clawstalker Sanctum on TT(TT only, all with gold to lvl 6)

At this point, you should be working towards a long term build goal, and can work on swapping out older buildings for different ones to adapt your build to your own needs.
You have most of the tools you'll need to continue growing into your late game stages. 
Play how you like and enjoy what you do, thanks for readingüçª
